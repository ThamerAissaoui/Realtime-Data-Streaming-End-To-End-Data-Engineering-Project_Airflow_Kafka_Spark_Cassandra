# Realtime Data Streaming E2E Data Engineering Project using Apache Airflow, Kafka, Zookeeper, Spark, Cassandra and Docker

Building a real-time data streaming pipeline, covering each phase from data ingestion to processing and finally storage. We'll utilize a powerful stack of tools and technologies, including Apache Airflow, Python, Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Spark, and Cassandraâ€”all neatly containerized using Docker.

ðŸ“š The Agenda: 

ðŸ‘‰ Setting up a data pipeline with Apache Airflow.

ðŸ‘‰ Streaming data with Kafka and Kafka Connect.

ðŸ‘‰ Using Zookeeper for distributed synchronization.

ðŸ‘‰ Data processing with Apache Spark.

ðŸ‘‰ Data storage solutions with Cassandra and PostgreSQL.

ðŸ‘‰ Containerizing the data engineering environment with Docker
